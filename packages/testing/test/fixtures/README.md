## Vendored Gutenberg Schema Fixtures

- `gutenberg-theme.schema.json` is copied from:
  - `gutenberg/schemas/json/theme.json`
  - upstream repo: `WordPress/gutenberg`
- Last sync source in this workspace:
  - local clone path: `gutenberg/schemas/json/theme.json`
  - verified on: `2026-02-11`

### Maintenance note

Keep this fixture byte-for-byte aligned with upstream unless we intentionally fork.
If a reviewer flags an entry as suspicious (for example, `core/query-total` refs),
confirm against upstream first before patching.
