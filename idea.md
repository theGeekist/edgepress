# Sunset Notice: `idea.md`

Status: Superseded on 2026-02-11.

The architectural direction previously captured in this file has been merged into the canonical spec:

- `docs/internal/edgepress-content-extensibility-spec.md`

Use that document for current platform architecture, content model, WP compatibility boundaries, extensibility contracts, and capability strategy.

`idea.md` is retained only as a stable path for legacy references.
