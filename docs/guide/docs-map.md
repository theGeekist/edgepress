# Docs Map

This site is organized by intent:

- Guide: how to run the repo and understand the layout. Start at [Getting Started](/guide/getting-started).
- Workflows: task-based docs that match what is implemented and tested. Start at [Auth](/guide/workflows/auth).
- Architecture: the mental model and invariants. Start at [Overview](/architecture/overview).
- Reference: stable contracts (API + SDK) and the platform boundaries. Start at [API](/reference/api/).
- Appendix: raw design/planning docs kept for history and context. Start at [Idea (raw)](/appendix/idea).

When in doubt, start with Workflows. Each workflow page links back to the test(s) that prove behavior.
