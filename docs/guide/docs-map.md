# Docs Map

This site is organized by intent:

- Guide: how to run the repo and understand the layout.
- Workflows: task-based docs that match what is implemented and tested.
- Architecture: the mental model and invariants.
- Reference: stable contracts (API + SDK) and the platform boundaries.
- Appendix: raw design/planning docs kept for history and context.

When in doubt, start with Workflows. Each workflow page links back to the test(s) that prove behavior.
